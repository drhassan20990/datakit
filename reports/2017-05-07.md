This report covers  weekly developments in the [moby/datakit], [mirage/irmin], [mirage/ocaml-git] and [mirage/ocaml-9p] repositories.

**TL;DR:** It's been a quiet week after the [previous week's](2017-04-24.md) slew of releases, with mainly packaging fixes and debugging deployments of DataKit CI in [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit).

## PRs merged

**Build and Packaging:**
- The automated release infrastructure was improved to support Jbuilder ([moby/datakit#543] [@samoht]).
- The GitHub bridge version constraints were fixed to improve OPAM installation ([moby/datakit#544] [@samoht]).
- The test harnesses were also extended to test on OCaml 4.03.0, which is the new minimum supported version of the compiler as of MirageOS 3.0 ([moby/datakit#546] [@samoht]).

**Functionality improvements:**
- The example 'self-ci' was updated to use the latest release of the GitHub bridge ([moby/datakit#545] [@samoht]).

### Ongoing activity

- [@samoht] updated the development tree to support the latest versions of the 9P and Lwt libraries ([moby/datakit#547] [@samoht]).
- [@djs55] has fixed the linking of the `protocol-9p-unix` subpackage to correctly link against `io-page.unix` ([mirage/ocaml-9p#121] [@djs55]).
- [@talex5] has been debugging a possible regression in the latest releases by investigating why Irmin is reporting all remote branches as having invalid names ([mirage/irmin#440] [@talex5]).

## External Links or Blogs

- Some of the code that powers DataKit is going to be [launched into space](https://twitter.com/avsm/status/860058980676141056)!
- A  Slack channel is now available to chat about DataKit over in [#datakit at Docker Community Slack](https://community.docker.com/registrations/groups/4316).
