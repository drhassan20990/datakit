# Weekly DataKit dev report for 2017-04-17 to 2017-04-23 (week 16)

This report covers weekly developments in the [moby/datakit], [mirage/irmin],
[mirage/ocaml-git], and [mirage/ocaml-9p] repositories.

**TL;DR:** The effort this week has gone into preparing for a release of the development
trees next week, and for the renaming of the project repositories to the
[Moby Project](http://mobyproject.org) (see [week17](2017-04-24.md) for more on this topic).
The use of multi-stage builds vastly decreased the size of the published containers to
just 21MB, which makes deploying DataKit much more efficient!

## PRs merged

**Build and Packaging:**
- The default Dockerfile now uses [multi-stage builds](https://blog.mikesir87.io/2017/03/introducing-docker-multi-stage-builds/) to vastly shrink the size of the DataKit containers from 1.4-1.7GB to 21-22MB! ([moby/datakit#522] [@talex5]). 
- Since the Docker Hub doesn't support multi-stage container builds yet, the Dockerfile
  used for autobuilds was inlined to ensure that the published images stay in sync. ([moby/datakit#521] [@talex5]).
- The root `opam` file is now called `datakit.opam` to make it fit with the other sub-packages ([moby/datakit#525] [@talex5]).
- The repositories and self-ci example were update for new repository locations ([moby/datakit#528] and [moby/datakit#520] [@talex5]).
- Windows CI of DataKit was fixed up to account for recent changes ([moby/datakit#527] [moby/datakit#122] [@talex5] [@samoht]).

**Functionality improvements:**
- The GitHub bridge can now read its private key using Docker Swarm secret management, which avoids the need to spread the secret authentication token any further than necessary ([moby/datakit#519] [@talex5] [@avsm]).
- The DataKit server no longer exposes an HTTP server. It was only used for debugging before, and Irmin 1.0 no longer supports it ([moby/datakit#524] [@samoht] [@talex5]).
- As DataKit is used more in production, [@talex5] has been steadily improving error handling to ensure that callers can handle failures more gracefully, either via retrying or logging exceptions ([moby/datakit#526] [@talex5]).

### PRs with activity

- [@djs55] uses DataKit in Docker for Mac for configuration management, and so he proposed a scheme to make branch handling  more robust for real-world use of this feature. His PR covers the case of software upgrades and user-supplied overrides for particular configuration keys ([moby/datakit#523]).
- [@avsm] requested that DataKit CI be able to monitor a complete GitHub organisation and add monitoring hooks by watching the rigth events. [@samoht] proposed a fix to this in [moby/datakit#419], but it has become outdated due to upstream changes, so he is rebasing it.
- [@samoht] is also working towards making DataKit log less verbose commit messages, to reduce the size of the state repository ([moby/datakit#476] [@samoht]).

- "[Optional Dependencies considered harmful](http://rgrinberg.com/posts/optional-dependencies-considered-harmful/)" by Rudi Grinberg explains very well why DataKit and Irmin now have explicit OPAM packages rather than `depopts` for optional functionality.
- "[Introducing Docker multistage builds](https://blog.mikesir87.io/2017/03/introducing-docker-multi-stage-builds)" explains how to achieve the extreme container shrinkage in your own projects.
