# Weekly DataKit dev report for 2017-04-24 to 2017-04-30 (week 17)

This report covers weekly developments in the [moby/datakit], [mirage/irmin], [mirage/ocaml-git] and [mirage/ocaml-9p] repositories.

**TL;DR:** The project now has a new home in the [Moby Project](http://mobyproject.org) and the main DataKit repository was renamed. There were three releases this week, of [moby/datakit:0.10.0], [mirage/irmin:1.1.0] and [mirage/ocaml-9p:v0.10.0], with mega build speedups and improvements to the DataKit Continuous Integration engine.

## PRs merged

**Build and Packaging:**
- DataKit was ported to use the new [Jbuilder](https://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder) build system for OCaml, resulting in a 4x speedup of compilation time and a more consistent linking strategy for the various DataKit subcomponents. See [moby/datakit#532] [moby/datakit#539] and [mirage/ocaml-9p#119] ([@diml] [@talex5] [@dbuenzli] [@samoht] [@djs55]).
- The DataKit trees were also refreshed to support the latest versions of Irmin, [Mirage3](https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release) and Cmdliner ([moby/datakit#529] [moby/datakit#531] [@talex5] [@samoht]).
- The 9P implementation now also supports the latest Lwt 3.0.0 interfaces ([mirage/ocaml-9p#117] [@djs55]).
- OPAM constraints for the `irmin-unix` and `irmin-git` packages were also fixed ([mirage/irmin#439] [@samoht]).

**Functionality improvements:**
- DataKit now allows the use of `/` in branch names ([moby/datakit#533] [@samoht]).
- The GitHub bridge was simplified by removing the VFS layer, which was intended to be useful for debugging but rarely used in practise ([moby/datakit#535] [@samoht]).
- The Continuous Integration subsystem was improved to make the required GitHub scopes configurable to make it easier to deploy on public GitHub repositories with less privilege ([moby/datakit#534] [@talex5] [@avsm]) and to accept SSH keys automatically when autocloning state repositories ([moby/datakit#536] [@talex5]).
- A regression in Irmin 1.0 in the `Irmin.Tree.diff` function, where nested diffs were reported with the wrong path was fixed ([mirage/irmin#438] [@samoht]).
- Irmin can now specify branches in URLs for the `fetch` function ([mirage/irmin#432] [@samoht]).

Thanks to [@samoht] [@avsm] and [@djs55] for handling all the release activity this week in [moby/datakit#538] [moby/datakit#540], [moby/datakit#541], [moby/datakit#542] and [mirage/ocaml-9p#120].

### PRs closed this week without merge

- [@kayceesrk] and [@samoht] have been discussing the semantics of merging `option` types in [mirage/irmin#421](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/issues/421), and concluded that Irmin 1.0.1 has the right semantics. [mirage/irmin#422] was closed as a result.

- [@yomimono] and [@samoht] did a lot of work in the runup to the MirageOS 3.0 release a few months ago to prepare DataKit for support, and all of that functionality is now present in DataKit 0.10, so [moby/datakit#433] and [moby/datakit#459] were closed.

- While building the [mirage-ci](https://github.com/avsm/mirage-ci), [@avsm] had reported that invalid job names from the CI resulted in inscrutable errors in the web interface. After some discussion, [@talex5] decided that [moby/datakit#492] wasn't worth the complexity, and that it should be addressed elsewhere.

- [@samoht] had put together a design for a `dkt` CLI tool in [moby/datakit#146]. While there were many good ideas in the design, it has never been implemented fully, so the PR is closed. Get in touch with [@samoht] if you'd like to build it!

## Ongoing activity

- The Golang DataKit bindings need to handle larger values better, so [@simonferquel] and [@samoht] are discussing merging [moby/datakit#292].
- The C# bindings to DataKit in [moby/datakit#334] are also awaiting review from [@dgageot] and [@simonferquel]. If you are interested in other language bindings, please create an issue.
- Irmin 1.1.0 is being improved by [@samoht] and [@talex5] to make it possible to distinguish between empty trees and nonexistent sub-trees in [mirage/irmin#431] and [mirage/irmin#433]. It will also add some new features such as `Irmin.Merge.idempotent` ([mirage/irmin#435]) and an `S.repo` type exposed ([mirage/irmin#436]).
- [@talex5] has opened a WIP PR in [mirage/ocaml-9p#118] to upstream some of the 9P patches used by DataKit in production, such as logging exceptions and keep-alive pings.
- The documentation is being improved by fixing the build instructions in [moby/datakit#537] ([@samoht] [@talex5]). More patches to improve the instructions are welcome!
