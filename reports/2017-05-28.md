# Weekly Datakit dev report for 2017-05-15 to 2017-05-28 (week 20 and 21)

This report covers two weeks of developments in the [moby/datakit] [mirage/irmin]
[mirage/ocaml-git] [mirage/ocaml-9p] repositories.

This week saw DataKit add direct client bindings that use Git directly, and
thus do not require a 9P server to be running. This improves performance and
deployment simplicity of DataKit, but removes the intermediate flexibility that
a 9P filesystem offers.

Datakit also features a local filesystem bridge, in addition to the remote
GitHub one, to faciliate desktop development with local repositories.  This
filesystem bridge was improved this week by using the latest Irmin release,
with better watch support [moby/datakit#577].

Most of these improvements are still in the various `master` branches of
Irmin and DataKit, and will appear in a release near you soon.

If you are interested in contributing to any of these repositories, then
[mirage/irmin#415] has a thread about coding standards and getting started
with the Irmin REST API. 

## PRs merged

Client API:

- **Golang:** separate user config from defaults in the database ([moby/datakit#523] [@djs55] [@talex5]).
- **Golang:** add `List` func in the `Snapshot` module to get files in a directory ([moby/datakit#578] [@ebriney])
- **OCaml/9P**: Remove `rename` API calls in the client, as there were no users and it doesn't work with 9P directories ([moby/datakit#563] [@talex5] [@samoht])
- **OCaml/Git:** Fix the `exists` function in the new Git client API ([moby/datakit#576] [@samoht]).
- **OCaml:** Renamed `Datakit_path` into `Datakit_client.Path` and `Datakit_S` into `Datakit_client.S`, to create a `Datakit_client` namespace ([moby/datakit#558] [@samoht])
- **OCaml:** Added client bindings that use Git directly without a 9P server process ([moby/datakit#559] [@samoht])
- Use `Irmin.Merge.idempotent` instead of re-implementing our own ([moby/datakit#564] [@samoht])
- `DK.commit` now fails if the commit does not exist ([moby/datakit#565] [@samoht])
- Build the `9pmount` helper in the the `datakit-client-9p` library instead of `datakit-client) ([moby/datakit#573] [@samoht])

Bridges:

- Use latest Irmin to fix issues with sync of local Git bridge ([moby/datakit#561] [@samoht])
- Fix regression in Irmin watches ([mirage/irmin#446] [@samoht]) that was causing the local filesystem bridge to fail ([moby/datakit#553] [@samoht] [@avsm])
- The CI now uses the dev version of `protocol-9p-unix` to avoid `End_of_file` exceptions ([moby/datakit#569] [mirage/ocaml-9p#126] [mirage/ocaml-9p#125] [@samoht])

Packaging:

- Update to latest Irmin ([moby/datakit#556] [@samoht])
- Use mtime 1.0 ([mirage/irmin#445] [moby/datakit#560] [moby/datakit#554] [@samoht])
- Clean up jbuild files after the build system port ([moby/datakit#568] [@samoht]) and add missing dependency towards `str` ([moby/datakit#572] [@samoht])
- Stop using camlzip in Datakit in favour of the ocaml-git implementation ([moby/datakit#570] [@samoht])
- Update CI to latest version of Redis ([moby/datakit#567] [@samoht])

Tests:

- Run the 9p tests in Datakit by default ([moby/datakit#566] [@samoht]) and fix warnings in the tests ([moby/datakit#571] [@samoht])
- Fix the collection of build artefacts on Windows and OSX ([moby/datakit#574] [@guillaumerose] [@samoht])
- add opam cache for appveyor [moby/datakit#575] [@samoht]
- Remove warnings in tests [mirage/irmin#447] [@samoht]
- Remove duplicated (and unused) file [mirage/ocaml-git#215] [@samoht]
- Remove warnings in tests [mirage/ocaml-git#216] [@samoht]
